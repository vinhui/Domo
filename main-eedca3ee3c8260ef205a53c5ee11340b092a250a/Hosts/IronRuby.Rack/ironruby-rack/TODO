Support rackup:
- Support .run for Rack::Handler::ASPNET and Rack::Handler::IIS
- rackup creates the rack app (from config.ru) for you,
  so the work is getting it remoted to the web-server process.

Generate simple script for running Cassini (aspnet.bat) from rack2aspnet

Create SQLServer database:
- Tomas has a script for this in IronRuby tools

Get clean on rack tests:
- See %DLR_ROOT%\Languages\Ruby\Tests\Scripts\utr\rack_tests.rb

More tests of IronRuby.Rack:
- See %DLR_ROOT%\Hosts\IronRuby.Rack\ironruby-rack\test\spec_*.rb
- Public dir test

Move IronRuby.Rack.dll and Cassini.exe directly into Lib dir; only the ruby scripts should
be in the bin dir?
