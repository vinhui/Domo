Directory structure:
    docutils       - the docutils package (downloaded from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils/0.5 )
    jinja2         - the jinja2 package (downloaded from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jinja2)
    sphinx         - the Sphinx RST converter tool (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx)
    PythonDocs     - CPython documentation rst (SVN pulled from http://svn.python.org/projects/python/branches/release26-maint/Doc)
    IronPythonDocs - IronPython documentation rst (same as Python docs + IronPython specific modifications)
    HtmlHelp.exe   - HTML Help Workshop installer
    

Generating documentation:
    Pre-reqs: You'll need to install Html Help Workshop before you can generate the CHM help.  This can be installed
    with the HtmlHelp.exe which is available in this directory.
    
    Then, from the root of the checkout, run `msbuild Solutions\Build.IronPython.proj /t:BuildChm`.

Updating Python Documentation:
    When updating the standard CPython documentation a new copy of the Doc folder should be pulled from CPython's
    respository (http://svn.python.org/projects/python/branches/release26-maint/Doc).  A 3-way merge should then
    be performed using PythonDocs as the base w/ IronPythonDocs and the newly pulled docs being merged.  The
    result of the merge should be saved in IronPythonDocs and the newly pulled documentation should replace the
    PythonDocs folder.
