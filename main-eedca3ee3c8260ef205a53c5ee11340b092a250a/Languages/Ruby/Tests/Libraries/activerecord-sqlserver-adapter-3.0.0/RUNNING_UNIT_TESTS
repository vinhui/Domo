= Creating the test databases

The default names for the test databases are "activerecord_unittest" and 
"activerecord_unittest2". If you want to use another database name then be sure 
to update the connection file that matches your connection method in 
test/connections/native_sqlserver_<connection_method>/connection.rb. Define a 
user named 'rails' in SQL Server with all privileges granted for the test 
databases. Use an empty password for said user.

The connection files make certain assumptions. For instance, the ODBC 
connection assumes you have a DSN setup that matches the name of the default 
database names. Remember too you have to set an environment variable for the 
DSN of the adapter, see the ODBC connection information for details.


= Cloning The Repos

Clone adapter git://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter.git. 
The master branch is the one under development for rails 3, track the repos 2-3-stable 
branch for 2.x development.

The tests of this adapter depend on the existence of the rails source which can 
be cloned at git://github.com/rails/rails.git. Like the adapter, the master is 
for 3.x development and it has its own 2-x-stable branches which can be tracked 
or checked out for local testing.

Set the RAILS_SOURCE environment variable with the full path of the rails repo. 
It is optional, but you can set an AREL environment variable to the path of your 
clone of the official git fork of arel found at git://github.com/rails/arel.git. 
As of now there is no need to do this as our Gemfile will source this and we currently 
host our own compiler in this project. 

Now with all that out of the way you can run "bundle install" to hook everything up. 
Our tests use bundler to setup the load paths correctly. If all goes well, you should 
be able to run "rake test" which will load all the adapter tests followed by the 
core ActiveRecord tests. Lastly, it is typically good practice to do your work 
on a local branch of our remote tracking branch.


= Current Patches

These patches may need to be applied in a local topic branch of whatever stable 
branch you are testing of rails.
